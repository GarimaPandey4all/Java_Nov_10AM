Creating First Program in Java

- Every java program start with class
- Class name should start with capital letter
- Class name should be same as file name
- Class name starts with either alphabet or special letter(_, $)

class Example {

data member/class variables
method/function

}

- Compile: javac filename.java
- Run	: java classname

- java comes from JRE, Now JRE starts searching for main

Main Method:

- main is a entry point of every java program
- Without main java will comoile the code and convert it into byte code, but it can't execute the code or interpret the code

4 types scopes in java

- public: global, which is accessible for all, from anywhere
- private: accessible within the class 
- protected: can be accessed inside the package/folder, can also be accessed outside the package by using inheritance
- default: The scope can be accessed by any class but within same package
